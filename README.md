# Flipkart-Laptop-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on performing a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a laptop dataset collected from an e-commerce platform. The dataset contains detailed information about various laptop models, including product names, ratings, reviews, prices, processor types, RAM capacity, storage specifications, discounts, and brand names. The goal of this analysis is to understand market patterns, customer preferences, and pricing trends by using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, ensuring that missing or inconsistent values are handled appropriately. Once the data is prepared, a series of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses are performed to uncover key trends. Price distribution plots help identify the different price segments such as budget, mid-range, and high-end laptops. Rating distributions reveal how satisfied customers are across different products. Brand-wise visualizations show which brands dominate the market in terms of pricing and popularity.

A detailed comparison of RAM sizes, processor types, and storage features further highlights how hardware specifications influence the overall cost of laptops. Scatter plots explore relationships such as how price correlates with ratings, while heatmaps provide an overview of how numerical features such as price, ratings, and storage are connected. Each visualization is supported with a short explanation that describes the insight gained from the chart.

The analysis reveals that laptops with SSD storage and higher RAM often receive better ratings, while premium brands tend to dominate the higher price range. Discounts vary widely across brands, indicating different marketing strategies. A large portion of laptops fall within the ₹40,000 to ₹70,000 range, making it the most competitive segment.

This project serves as a strong example of EDA for e-commerce datasets. It not only uncovers meaningful insights but also demonstrates the use of Python for data exploration, visualization, and interpretation. The final notebook presents all visualizations with clear descriptions, making it a complete and insightful analytical study suitable for academic submissions, GitHub portfolios, or data analytics practice.
